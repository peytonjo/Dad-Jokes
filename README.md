# Stretch Technology Group Project
This project is centered around thinking of a distinct problem and creating an application to solve the problem while learning a new technology. The main objective is not to have a fully functional application but instead use it as practice for learning Cypress while creating a minimal viable product. 


## Project Description:


The complete project spec and rubric can be found [here]().

## Setup Instructions:
  1. `Fork` [this repository](https://github.com/peytonjo/Dad-Jokes).
  1. `Clone` it down to your local machine with `git clone <your SSH Key>`.
  1. Change into your directory with 
  1. Run `npm install` to compile the React application.
  1. Run `npm start` to see the app running locally.
  1. Run `<your text editor> .` to see the code in your text editor.
  1. Run `npm test` to see all of the tests running in your Terminal.

### User Experience:
